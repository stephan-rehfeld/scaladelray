/**
 * This class represents an orthographic camera. All rays of the camera are pointing in the same direction but have
 * different origin. The image plane has a default height of 1. The width is adjusted to the aspect ratio. The size of
 * the image plane can be adjusted by the parameter s.
 *
 * @author Stephan Rehfeld
 *
 * @param e The position of the camera.
 * @param g The gaze direction of the camera.
 * @param t The up vector of the camera.
 * @param width The width of the image.
 * @param height The height of the image.
 * @param s The scale factor of the image plane.
 * @param samplingPattern The sampling pattern that should be used by generating the rays. The default is a regular sampling pattern with only one point.
